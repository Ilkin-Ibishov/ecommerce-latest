### 26. Shared Multi-Tenancy (Platform Big Bet — DEFERRED)
**Impact:** 🔴 High (long-term) — collapses per-store infra cost as store count grows  
**Effort:** Very High — touches every table, route, auth path, storage call + risky live-store migration  
**Status:** Deferred. No current demand; first store is a pilot (friend's store) on the existing isolated model. Revisit at ~8–10 stores when per-store onboarding cost/ops overhead becomes painful.  
**What:** Move from "one Supabase project + one Vercel deploy per store" to a single shared DB + deploy with `store_id` columns, RLS tenant isolation, and domain/subdomain tenant resolution.  
**Spec:** `.kiro/specs/shared-multi-tenancy/requirements.md` (full requirements already drafted and parked)  
**When revisiting:** add per-tenant SEO (server-rendered sitemap/robots/OG/JSON-LD scoped by `store_id`); reuse the isolated-model provisioning script for the `/platform/stores/provision` endpoint.  
**Interim higher-leverage work:** automate the current isolated onboarding (schema migration + AZ-market default seeding + admin user + Control Plane registration).
